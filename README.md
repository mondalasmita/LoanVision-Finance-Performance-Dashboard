**Step 2: Primary KPI Design**
- Key metrics, including *Total Loan Applications*, *Total Funded Amount*, *Total Amount Received*, *Average Interest Rate*, and *Average Debt-to-Income Ratio*, were calculated using Excel functions .
- Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) comparisons were added to track short-term changes.

**Step 3: Dashboard Layout**
- A dashboard layout was designed in Excel with sections for *Good Loans*, *Bad Loans*, and overall performance metrics.
